# CSV_2_DB
STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
Template for a script that formats a csv file and stores the info in a mysql database (written in Python 3.4.0).
In order to use this, the FTP credentials and SQL statements will have to be modified.
Also, you will need to install MySQL Connector/Python, which allows you to import mysql.connector.
I am personally using it for csv files downloaded from my account with the MailChimp email service.
